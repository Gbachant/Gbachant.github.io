                              Each group of perpendicular bearings is
                              represented by a different color. The grouping
                              of grids becomes immediately apparent. What is
                              most interesting are groups of grids that aren't
                              connected; though they are physically seperated
                              they still follow the same bearings. For
                              instance note the two purple bearing groups: one
                              at the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn and
                              Manhattan bridges and the other to the far east
                              of Prospect Park in the bottom right corner of

                              Note how the purple bearings on the Brooklyn
                              end of the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges merge
                              with and become part of the grids of the dark
                              orange bearings just south of the Brooklyn Navy
                              Yard. One of the main things I was interested in
                              doing with this project was analyzing the
                              'borders' of groups of grids and how their edges
                              met and bonded together.

        This is project I have been interested in doing for quite some time now.
        It was inspired by looking at the beautiful and chaotic mixing together
        of grids in New York City,
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brooklyn,+NY/@40.6496725,-73.9659865,12.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24416947c2109:0x82765c7404007886!8m2!3d40.6781784!4d-73.9441579">Brookyn</a>
        in particular. I became interested in finding a way to organize and
        analyze the relationships of the various grids based on angles of their
        bearings. It wasn't until I found <a href="https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx">OSMnx</a>,
        a Python package for working with and analyzing OpenStreetMap files made
        by <a href="http://geoffboeing.com/">Geoff Boeing</a>, that I was able to
        find the right tool to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        OSMnx comes with many useful functions for analyzing maps by default.
        One such function is the ability to retrieve the bearings
        of a network's streets and <a href="https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/15-calculate-visualize-edge-bearings.ipynb">graph their frequency</a>,
        but this wasn't enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone familiar with working with OpenStreetMap files will know that they
        aren't exactly perfect representations. This is due to the very nature of
        how they are created. OSM files are composed of nodes and ways. Most of
        these nodes and ways were placed by humans physically overlaying them onto
        satellite imagery and can be prone to human error. As a result, nodes and ways that
        should theoretically be perfectly aligned and ordered are not.</p>
      <p>
        To overcome this I accessed the <code>bearing</code> attribute inside
        the networkx multidigraph and created another attribute,<code>rounded_bearing</code>,
        composed of <code>bearing</code> rounded to an integer. This allows us to
        filter the graph by edge bearings much easier and even chose to only
        graph the bearings that we desire.
      </p>
      <p>I also added another attribute <code>modulo_bearing</code> which is just
        the <code>rounded_bearing</code>modulo 90. By using modulo 90 I was able
        to get all edges placed into 90 groups composed of edges who share either
        parallel or perpendicular edge bearings. From there I was able use an
        osmnx function,<code>osmnx.get_edge_colors_by_attr()</code>, to assign a
        different color to each of the 90 groups of edges and eventually plot them.
